  <h3 id="collecting-data">Collecting Data</h3>
<p>This data was wildly available online for me to use, however, it was difficult to find any in csv, api or more manageable form. I had to scrape the information from transfermarkt.com to get what I needed. This process was difficult for a variety of reasons. First, the website was created in Germany, meaning all of the tags and notes inside of the webpage were all in German. This made understanding of what was going on a little more difficult. Next, the website did not follow the tightest html standards, and this caused me difficulties in several situations. Finally, since Germany uses commas to delimit decimals and periods to show value in large numbers, it took some time to reformat this data to be used appropriately.</p>

<p>A discussion of the process can be found <a href="https://ggrahambaker.github.io/blog/2019/06/11/webscraping-transfermarkt">here</a>.</p>
